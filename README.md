# 🔁 LangGraph Predictive Workflow

LangGraph-based project demonstrating **predictive workflows** using LLM agents, sequential and parallel steps, and conditional routing. Ideal for building robust multi-step LLM applications.

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **predictive workflow** using [LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.dev/), which enables defining workflows for LLMs using graphs. It showcases how to:

* Design sequential and parallel nodes.
* Use conditional logic (if/else).
* Integrate LLMs for decision-making.
* Pass state between nodes.
* Predict next best steps using context.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Modular LangGraph design
* 🤖 LLM integration (OpenAI or others)
* 🔄 Parallel and sequential execution
* 🧠 Predictive node branching
* 🛠️ Easily extendable for custom use-cases

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-predictive-workflow.git
cd langgraph-predictive-workflow
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Workflow

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

* User input: `"I want to build a chatbot"`
* Workflow:

  * Input node receives query
  * Processing node identifies intent
  * Predictive node decides:

    * → Go to chatbot architecture suggestion
    * or → Ask follow-up questions

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify:

* Nodes: Create your own in `/nodes`
* Routing: Edit `main.py` for graph logic
* LLM: Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.
