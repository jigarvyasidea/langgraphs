            "{'question': 'Who is PM of India?', 'answer': AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out who the Prime Minister of India is. I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head, but I think it's someone who's been in the news a lot. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indian politics. India is a democratic country with a parliamentary system, so they have a Prime Minister as the head of government.\\n\\nI remember that before the current PM, there was Manmohan Singh. He was the PM for two terms, from 2004 to 2014. But that's a while back. After him, I think there was a change in the government. I believe the BJP, which is the Bharatiya Janata Party, came into power. Their leader, I think, became the PM.\\n\\nWait, the name Narendra Modi comes to mind. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat before becoming PM. He's been quite a prominent figure, known for various policies and initiatives. I think he became PM in 2014. Since then, he's been re-elected, maybe in 2019? That seems right.\\n\\nSo, putting this together, the Prime Minister of India as of now is Narendra Modi. He's been in office for a couple of terms, which suggests he's been leading the country for nearly a decade now. I should double-check this to make sure I'm not confusing him with someone else, but I'm pretty confident it's him.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi. He has been serving in this position since 2014 and was re-elected in 2019, leading the country for nearly a decade.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 334, 'prompt_tokens': 16, 'total_tokens': 350, 'completion_time': 1.463227395, 'prompt_time': 0.000557083, 'queue_time': 0.20183806499999998, 'total_time': 1.463784478}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_76307ac09b', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--82cc2a8d-275a-4473-b1fe-015676853d52-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 16, 'output_tokens': 334, 'total_tokens': 350})}\n"
